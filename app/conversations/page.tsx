  /**
   * Conversation State Management
   *
   * Manages conversation state using the useConversation hook to determine
   * whether a conversation is currently open. This state management enables
   * conditional rendering and responsive layout that ensures optimal user
   * experience for conversation discovery and messaging interface.
   *
   * What useConversation provides:
   * - isOpen: Boolean flag indicating if a conversation is currently active
   * - conversationId: String ID of the currently active conversation
   * - URL parameter extraction: Conversation state derived from URL parameters
   * - State optimization: useMemo for efficient state management
   * - Type safety: Type-safe conversation state extraction
   *
   * Why use isOpen for conditional rendering?
   * - User experience: Shows empty state when no conversation is selected
   * - Navigation: Hides home page when conversation is active
   * - Responsive design: Different visibility patterns for different states
   * - Performance: Efficient conditional rendering based on state
   * - Consistency: Maintains consistent conversation state awareness
   *
   * This conversation state management is essential for our messaging app because
   * it provides the state awareness that enables conditional rendering and
   * responsive layout throughout the conversation discovery and messaging interface.
