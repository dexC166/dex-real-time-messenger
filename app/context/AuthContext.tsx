/**
 * Authentication Context Provider for Dex Real-Time Messenger
 *
 * This file provides a client-side authentication context wrapper for our Next.js 14
 * real-time messaging application. It wraps the entire application with NextAuth.js's
 * SessionProvider, enabling client-side access to authentication state, session data,
 * and authentication methods throughout all React components.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Client-side authentication state management
 * - Session data access via useSession hook
 * - Authentication methods (signIn, signOut) via NextAuth.js
 * - Real-time session updates and synchronization
 * - Integration with NextAuth.js configuration
 *
 * Usage Patterns:
 * - Root layout wrapper for app-wide authentication
 * - Client components accessing session data
 * - Authentication forms and login/logout functionality
 * - Protected component rendering and navigation
 * - Real-time messaging user identification
 *
 * This context is essential for our messaging app because it provides the
 * client-side authentication foundation that enables components to access
 * user session data, handle authentication flows, and maintain secure
 * user state throughout the real-time messaging platform.

/**
 * Authentication Context Provider Component
 *
 * A React context provider that wraps the entire application with NextAuth.js's
 * SessionProvider, enabling client-side access to authentication state and methods.
 * This component serves as the foundation for all client-side authentication
 * functionality in our real-time messaging application.
 *
 * Key Capabilities:
 * - Provides authentication context to all child components
 * - Enables useSession hook usage throughout the app
 * - Manages client-side session state and updates
 * - Integrates with NextAuth.js server-side configuration
 * - Handles session synchronization and persistence
 *
 * Context Features:
 * - Session data access (user, status, loading states)
 * - Authentication methods (signIn, signOut, getSession)
 * - Real-time session updates and refresh
 * - Automatic session validation and cleanup
 * - Error handling and loading states
 *
 * Usage in Components:
 * - AuthForm: Access session status and authentication methods
 * - ConversationBox: Identify current user for message display
 * - ConversationList: Manage user-specific conversation data
 * - MessageBox: Determine message ownership and styling
 * - useOtherUser: Get other user in conversations
 * - useRoutes: Handle logout and navigation
 *
 * Integration with NextAuth.js:
 * - Automatically connects to server-side auth configuration
 * - Uses authOptions from @/app/libs/authOptions
 * - Supports JWT-based session management
 * - Handles OAuth and credentials authentication
 * - Manages session persistence and security
 *
 * Security Considerations:
 * - Session data is validated against server-side configuration
 * - JWT tokens are automatically verified and refreshed
 * - Session expiration is handled gracefully
 * - Authentication state is synchronized across tabs
 * - Secure session storage and transmission
 *
 * This component is crucial for our messaging app because it provides the
 * client-side authentication infrastructure that enables secure user access
 * to real-time messaging features, conversation management, and user
 * identification throughout our React component tree.
 *
 * @param {AuthContextProps} props - Component props containing children to wrap
 * @returns {JSX.Element} SessionProvider wrapping the children components
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * // In app/layout.tsx
 * <AuthContext>
 *   <ToasterContext />
 *   <ActiveStatus />
 *   {children}
 * </AuthContext>
 *
 * // In any client component
 * const { data: session, status } = useSession();
 * const { signIn, signOut } = useSession();
 * ```

  /**
   * NextAuth.js Session Provider
   *
   * Wraps the children components with NextAuth.js's SessionProvider, which
   * provides authentication context and session management capabilities to
   * all child components in our messaging application.
   *
   * Why use SessionProvider?
   * - Provides React context for authentication state
   * - Enables useSession hook usage in components
   * - Manages client-side session synchronization
   * - Handles automatic session refresh and validation
   * - Integrates seamlessly with NextAuth.js configuration
   *
   * Context Benefits:
   * - Centralized authentication state management
   * - Real-time session updates across components
   * - Automatic session persistence and restoration
   * - Consistent authentication API across the app
   * - Built-in loading and error states
   *
   * This wrapper is essential for our messaging app because it enables
   * all client components to access authentication state and methods,
   * providing the foundation for secure user interactions and real-time
   * messaging functionality throughout our React application.
