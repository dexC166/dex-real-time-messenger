 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Global toast notification system using react-hot-toast
 * - App-wide user feedback for all operations
 * - Error handling and success message display
 * - Non-intrusive notification overlay system
 * - Consistent user experience across all components
 *
 * Usage Patterns:

 * - API operation feedback (message sending, conversation creation)
 * - Error handling for failed operations
 * - Success confirmations for user actions
 * - Loading states and progress indicators
 *
 * This context is essential for our messaging app because it provides the
 * user feedback infrastructure that enables clear communication about
 * operation status, errors, and successes throughout the real-time

 *
 * Toast Types Used in App:
 * - toast.success(): Success messages (login, registration, settings update)
 * - toast.error(): Error messages (authentication failures, API errors)
 * - toast.loading(): Loading states (optional, for long operations)
 * - toast.dismiss(): Manual dismissal (optional, for custom control)
 *
 * Usage in Components:
 * - AuthForm: Login/registration success and error feedback
 * - SettingsModal: Profile update success and error feedback

 *
 * This component is crucial for our messaging app because it provides the
 * user feedback system that keeps users informed about operation status,
 * errors, and successes, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience
 * throughout our real-time messaging platform.
 *
 * @returns {JSX.Element} Toaster component for global notifications
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * // In app/layout.tsx
 * <ToasterContext />
 *
 * // In any component
 * import toast from 'react-hot-toast';
 *
 * // Success notification
 * toast.success('Logged in successfully!');
 *
 * // Error notification
 * toast.error('Invalid credentials');
 *
 * // Loading notification
 * const loadingToast = toast.loading('Sending message...');
 * // Later: toast.dismiss(loadingToast);
 * ```
