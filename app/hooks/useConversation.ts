/**
 * Conversation State Management Hook for Dex Real-Time Messenger
 *
 * This file provides a specialized useConversation hook for our Next.js 14
 * real-time messaging application. It implements conversation state management
 * with URL parameter extraction, conversation awareness, and state optimization
 * that ensures optimal user experience for conversation-based features
 * throughout the messaging platform.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - URL parameter extraction for conversationId from Next.js dynamic routes
 * - Conversation state management with isOpen boolean flag
 * - useMemo optimization for performance and re-render prevention
 * - Type-safe conversationId extraction and validation
 * - Conversation awareness for conditional rendering and navigation
 *
 * Conversation State Usage Patterns:
 * - MobileFooter: Conditional rendering based on conversation open state
 * - ConversationList: Real-time conversation updates and navigation
 * - Form components: Message sending with conversationId context
 * - Body components: Message display and real-time updates
 * - Page components: Conversation-specific layout and functionality
 *
 * This hook is essential for our messaging app because it provides the
 * conversation state management that enables conversation-aware features,
 * conditional rendering, and real-time messaging functionality throughout our
 * real-time messaging platform.

/**
 * Conversation State Management Hook
 *
 * A comprehensive conversation hook that provides conversation state management
 * for our messaging application. This hook implements URL parameter extraction,
 * conversation awareness, and state optimization that ensures optimal user
 * experience for conversation-based features throughout the messaging platform.
 *
 * Key Capabilities:
 * - URL parameter extraction for conversationId from Next.js dynamic routes
 * - Conversation state management with isOpen boolean flag
 * - useMemo optimization for performance and re-render prevention
 * - Type-safe conversationId extraction and validation
 * - Conversation awareness for conditional rendering and navigation
 *
 * Conversation State Types Supported:
 * - Active conversation: conversationId present in URL parameters
 * - Inactive conversation: No conversationId in URL parameters
 * - Open state: Boolean flag indicating conversation is active
 * - Closed state: Boolean flag indicating no active conversation
 * - URL-based state: Conversation state derived from URL parameters
 *
 * Usage Patterns:
 * - MobileFooter: Conditional rendering based on conversation open state
 * - ConversationList: Real-time conversation updates and navigation
 * - Form components: Message sending with conversationId context
 * - Body components: Message display and real-time updates
 * - Page components: Conversation-specific layout and functionality
 *
 * Conversation Features:
 * - URL parameter extraction: useParams for conversationId from dynamic routes
 * - State optimization: useMemo for efficient state management
 * - Type safety: Type-safe conversationId extraction and validation
 * - Conversation awareness: isOpen flag for conditional rendering
 * - Performance: Optimized state updates and re-render prevention
 *
 * Performance Features:
 * - useMemo optimization: Prevents unnecessary re-renders
 * - Dependency arrays: Efficient state update triggers
 * - State caching: Memoized conversation state for performance
 * - URL synchronization: Real-time URL parameter updates
 * - Memory efficiency: Optimized state object generation
 *
 * This hook is crucial for our messaging app because it provides the
 * conversation state management that enables conversation-aware features,
 * conditional rendering, and real-time messaging functionality throughout all
 * conversation-based interfaces.
 *
 * @returns {Object} Conversation state object with isOpen and conversationId properties
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * // In MobileFooter
 * const { isOpen } = useConversation();
 *
 * // In ConversationList
 * const { conversationId, isOpen } = useConversation();
 *
 * // In Form components
 * const { conversationId } = useConversation();
 *
 * // State object structure
 * {
 *   isOpen: boolean,
 *   conversationId: string
 * }
 * ```

   * URL Parameters Extraction
   *
   * Extracts URL parameters from Next.js dynamic routes for conversation
   * state management. This provides the core functionality for conversation
   * identification and state awareness within the messaging system.
   *
   * What this provides:
   * - URL parameters: useParams hook for dynamic route parameters
   * - Conversation identification: conversationId from URL parameters
   * - Route awareness: Current route parameter extraction
   * - Dynamic routing: Next.js dynamic route parameter access
   * - State foundation: Base for conversation state management
   *
   * Why this pattern?
   * - URL-based state: Conversation state derived from URL parameters
   * - Dynamic routing: Next.js dynamic route parameter access
   * - State management: Foundation for conversation state
   * - Performance: Efficient parameter extraction
   * - Integration: Seamless integration with Next.js routing
   *
   * This parameter extraction is essential for our messaging app because
   * it provides the conversation identification that enables
   * conversation-aware features and state management throughout the
   * messaging platform.

   *
   * What this provides:
   * - Conversation ID: Extracted conversationId from URL parameters
   * - Type safety: Type-safe conversationId extraction and validation
   * - Fallback handling: Empty string fallback for missing conversationId
   * - State optimization: useMemo for efficient state management
   * - URL synchronization: Real-time URL parameter updates
