/**
 * Get Conversation by ID
 *
 * Retrieves a specific conversation by its unique identifier with basic
 * participant information. This server action implements conversation
 * lookup functionality with session validation and basic security checks
 * that ensures proper conversation access for messaging operations.
 *
 * Key Capabilities:
 * - Server-side conversation lookup by unique ID
 * - Basic session validation and authentication
 * - Participant information inclusion
 * - Error handling with graceful fallbacks
 * - Integration with conversation management system
 *
 * Conversation Lookup Features:
 * - Individual conversation retrieval by ID
 * - Conversation metadata (name, isGroup, lastMessageAt, createdAt)
 * - User participants for conversation display
 * - Basic security with session validation
 * - Optimized database query with participant includes
 *
 * Usage Patterns:
 * - Conversation validation: Verify conversation exists before operations
 * - Conversation display: Basic conversation data for UI components
 * - Participant lookup: User information for conversation participants
 * - Conversation management: Basic conversation metadata access
 * - API integration: Server-side conversation data fetching
 *
 * Database Query Features:
 * - Prisma conversation.findUnique: Efficient single record lookup
 * - ID-based filtering: Direct conversation access by unique identifier
 * - User includes: Participant information for conversation display
 * - MongoDB integration: Efficient NoSQL querying with Prisma
 * - Type safety: Prisma-generated TypeScript types
 *
 * Security Considerations:
 * - Session validation ensures only authenticated users
 * - Basic authentication check with email validation
 * - Error handling prevents information leakage
 * - Graceful fallbacks maintain application stability
 * - Note: Missing user-specific conversation filtering (security gap)
 *
 * Performance Features:
 * - Server-side fetching: Optimal performance with pre-loaded data
 * - Database optimization: Efficient single record lookup
 * - Error handling: Prevents application crashes
 * - Caching: Server-side rendering benefits
 * - Type safety: Prisma-generated TypeScript types
 *
 * Security Note:
 * This function currently lacks user-specific conversation filtering,
 * which means it could potentially return conversations the user
 * doesn't have access to. Consider adding userIds filtering for
 * enhanced security, similar to the API route implementation.
 *
 * This function is useful for our messaging app because it provides the
 * basic conversation lookup functionality that enables conversation
 * validation and basic metadata access, though it should be enhanced
 * with proper security filtering for production use.
 *
 * @param {string} conversationId - The unique identifier for the conversation to retrieve
 * @returns {Promise<(Conversation & { users: User[] }) | null>} Conversation object with users, or null if not found/error
 * @throws Never throws - Returns null for any errors to maintain graceful degradation
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Basic conversation lookup
 * const conversation = await getConversationById('conversation-id-123');
 * if (conversation) {
 *   console.log('Conversation found:', conversation.name);
 * }
 *
 * // In server components
 * const conversation = await getConversationById(params.conversationId);
 * if (!conversation) {
 *   return <NotFound />;
 * }
 * ```

     * Current User Authentication
     *
     * Retrieves the current authenticated user using the getCurrentUser action
     * to ensure only authenticated users can access conversation data. This
     * authentication check provides basic security and user context for
     * conversation access and data retrieval.
     *
     * What getCurrentUser provides:
     * - Current user session validation
     * - User ID and email for authentication verification
     * - User profile information for conversation context
     * - Session state management
     * - Authentication status confirmation
     *
     * Why authenticate before querying?
     * - Security: Prevents unauthorized access to conversation data
     * - User context: Provides user information for potential filtering
     * - Data integrity: Ensures only authenticated users can access conversations
     * - Performance: Avoids unnecessary database queries for unauthenticated users
     * - Consistency: Maintains consistent authentication flow
     *
     * This authentication is essential for our messaging app because
     * it ensures that only authenticated users can access conversation
     * data while maintaining basic security throughout the platform.

     *
     * What this handles:
     * - No active user session
     * - Invalid or expired authentication tokens
     * - User not found in database
     * - Authentication service failures
     * - Session validation errors
     *
     * Why return null for no user?
     * - Security: Prevents unauthorized access to conversation data
     * - Consistency: Maintains consistent return type
     * - Graceful degradation: Handles unauthenticated state
     * - User experience: Prevents errors in UI components
     * - Performance: Avoids unnecessary database queries

     * This unauthenticated handling is essential for our messaging app because
     * it ensures that conversation data remains secure and the application
     * behaves predictably for all user authentication states.

     * - UI rendering: All data needed for conversation participants
     * - User experience: Complete conversation context
     * - Performance: Reduces additional database queries
     * - Integration: Works with conversation display components
