 * @returns {Promise<void>} Sends Pusher authorization token or error status
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Pusher client automatically calls this endpoint
 * const pusher = new PusherClient(key, {
 *   channelAuthorization: {
 *     endpoint: '/api/pusher/auth',
 *     transport: 'ajax'

   * User Session Authentication and Validation
   *
   * Validates the current user's authentication status using NextAuth.js
   * session management. This authentication ensures only authenticated
   * users can access private Pusher channels and maintains proper
   * security for real-time messaging.
   *
   * What this provides:
   * - Current user session validation
   * - User authentication status verification
   * - User context for channel authorization
   * - Security validation for channel access
   * - User identification for presence tracking
   *
   * Why authentication is essential:
   * - Security: Ensures only authenticated users can access private channels
   * - User context: Provides user identification for channel authorization
   * - Access control: Validates user permissions for channel access
   * - Data privacy: Prevents unauthorized access to conversation data
   * - Presence tracking: Enables user identification for online status
   *
   * Authentication Logic:
   * - getServerSession: Retrieves current user session from NextAuth.js
   * - Session validation: Checks session?.user?.email exists
   * - Error response: 401 status for unauthenticated users
   * - User context: Provides user email for channel authorization
   * - Security: Ensures proper user authentication
   *
   * This authentication is essential for our messaging app because it provides
   * the security and user context that enables proper channel authorization
   * and access control throughout our real-time messaging platform.

   * Unauthenticated User Handling
   *
   * Handles cases where the user is not authenticated by returning a 401
   * unauthorized response. This provides clear error handling for
   * unauthenticated requests attempting to access private Pusher channels.
   *
   * What this handles:
   * - Unauthenticated user requests
   * - Missing user session scenarios
   * - Security validation for channel access
   * - Clear error responses
   * - Privacy protection
   *
   * Why 401 response for unauthenticated users:
   * - Security: Prevents unauthorized access to private channels
   * - Clear error: Provides explicit unauthorized status
   * - User experience: Clear indication of authentication requirement
   * - API standards: Follows HTTP status code conventions
   * - Best practices: Proper error handling for authentication failures
   *
   * This unauthenticated handling is essential for our messaging app because
   * it provides the security that prevents unauthorized channel access
   * and maintains proper access control throughout our messaging platform.
