# Real-Time-Messenger üì®

A full-featured, real-time chat platform built with **Next.js 14 (App Router)** and **TypeScript**.

---

## üìå Project Overview

This is **my** implementation of a Facebook-style messenger.  
It delivers instant chat, read receipts, media sharing, and presence indicators all wrapped in a sleek, responsive UI.

**Highlights**

- üí¨ Instant messaging with real-time updates (Pusher)
- üëÄ Read receipts & online/offline indicators
- üìé Image / file uploads (Cloudinary)
- üë• One-on-one **and** group conversations
- üîç In-thread message search
- üîê Secure auth (credentials + Google / GitHub OAuth)
- üñ•Ô∏è Mobile-first responsive design

> **Inspiration:** Antonio Erdeljac‚Äôs Messenger Clone tutorial jump-started this build, but files have been reviewed, refactored, and expanded to match **my** standards.

## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

I‚Äôm **Dayle Cortes**, a full-stack developer focused on responsive web experiences.  
This messenger app showcases my ability to integrate modern frameworks, realtime infrastructure, and elegant UI design into a production-ready app.

## üôè Acknowledgments

- **Antonio Erdeljac** aka "_codewithantonio_", his tutorial kick-started this build.
- The open-source communities behind **Next.js**, **Prisma**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Pusher**.

## üìå Note

This app was originally built by following @codewithantonio‚Äôs YouTube tutorial for learning and inspiration.  
The project was developed entirely in my local IDE, outside of GitHub, and I‚Äôve reconstructed the commit history solely to reflect a realistic development flow and demonstrate my understanding of fullstack architecture, not as a record of the actual chronological build.
